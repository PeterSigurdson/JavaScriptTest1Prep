In this Lab, you will learn how to manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript. 

What the Document Object Model really is:
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for 
HTML and XML documents. 
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, 
style, and content. 
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. 
That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
